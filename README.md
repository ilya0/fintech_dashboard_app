# fintech_dashboard_app

This is a test to create a dash board with finanicals api's and to
show a real time display of various financial data
hopefully I can use angular or react to do the front end 
and maybe node for the back

I need to do some research on the various finance apis available
and start to pull them in a real time updating way

d3

Pubnub

Current issues:
1. Creating a live streaming APi with data that will me immeidiately and unlimitedly accessible
2. Creating a front end that will refresh itself continuously


Current Ideas
using pubnub to get api data
using html to create a template
finished product should use some sort of angualr or react
I would prefer react
Use p5 or d3 to create a motion graphic in html
