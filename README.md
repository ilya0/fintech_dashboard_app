# fintech_dashboard_app

This is a test to create a dash board with finanicals api's and to
show a real time display of various financial data
hopefully I can use angular or react to do the front end 
and maybe node for the back

I need to do some research on the various finance apis available
and start to pull them in a real time updating way
